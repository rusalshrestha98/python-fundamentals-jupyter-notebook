    "# Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.) Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python is a general-purpose coding languageâ€”which means that, unlike HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it can be used for other types of programming and software development besides web development.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Python used for?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Web-Development\n",
    "* Software Development\n",
    "* Mathematics\n",
    "* Machine Learning\n",
    "* Data Science\n",
    "* Automation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).\n",
    "* Simple syntax similar to the English language.\n",
    "* Syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.\n",
    "* Large, mature, and active supportive community\n",
    "* Hundreds of libraries and frameworks\n",
    "* More efficient, reliable, and faster than most modern languages\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Good to Know\n",
    "\n",
    "* The most recent version of Python is Python 3. However, Python 2 is still quite popular.\n",
    "* You can run Python in you command line, but it probably easiest to run it using a text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.) Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Many PCs and Macs will already come with python installed. However, if your machine does not have it available, you can go to https://python.org/downloads/ and follow the instructions for your operating system to get it downloaded on your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.) Pip\n",
    "\n",
    "Pip is the most popular package manager for python. To check if you have pip installed, run the following command.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Windows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "py -m pip --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Mac:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "py -m pip --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If not installed, you can follow the installation documentation for pip at this link: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/. \n"
