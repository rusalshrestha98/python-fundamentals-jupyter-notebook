# Operators

## 1.) Arithmetic Operators
#### Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:
##### Example:
```python
+   Addition
-   Subtraction
*   Multiplication
/   Division
%   Modulus
**  Exponentiation
//  Floor division
```

## 2.) Assignment Operators
#### Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:
##### Example:
```python
Operator        Example         Same As
=               x = 2           x = 2
+=              x += 2          x = x + 2
-=              x -= 2          x = x - 2
*=              x *= 2          x = x * 2
/=              x /= 2          x = x / 2
%=              x %= 2          x = x % 2
//=	            x //= 3	        x = x // 3
**=	            x **= 3	        x = x ** 3
&=	            x &= 3	        x = x & 3
|=	            x |= 3	        x = x | 3
```

## 3.) Comparison operators 
#### Comparison operators are used to compare two values:
```python
Operator        Example         Same As
==	            Equal	        x == y
!=	            Not equal	    x != y	
>	            Greater than	x > y	
<	            Less than	    x < y	
>=	            Greater than    x >= y 
                or equal to		
<=	            Less than       x <= y
                or equal to	
```

## 4.) Logical Operators 
#### Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:
```python
Operator        Description         Example
and 	        Returns True        x < 5
                if both             and
                statements          x < 10
                are true	 

or	            Returns True        x < 5
                if one of the       or
                statements          x < 4
                is true		

not	            Reverse the         not(x<5
                result, returns     and
                False if the        x < 10)
                result is true
```

## 5.) Identity Operators
#### Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:
```python
                and: 
Returns True if both statements are true
                or: 
Returns True if one of the statements is true
                not: 
Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true      
```

## 6.) Membership Operators
#### Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object:
```python
in: 
Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object
not in:
Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object
```
